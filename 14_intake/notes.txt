K14 - Requests on a client server
Time Spent: 0.5 hr
DISCO:
* Statments like "127.0.0.1 - - [07/Oct/2024 11:37:44] "GET /auth HTTP/1.1" 200" show what paths were accessed
* Any username produces the same output
* When testmod0.py is imported it's name is not main. 
* There is a text box to input a username and the page saying "hah hooh HAAH" appears no matter what text is inputted.
* There is a KeyError if there is no username.
* If you run just testmod0.py in the terminal, it just prints the text in the file.
* testmod0 is being imported as a package in app.py
* Args gives the arguments within the request and header gives info about the request
* When print(request.args['username']) is uncommented in the root path there is a BadRequestkeyError because there is no value for username yet in the dictionary for args
* sub1 is submission 1
* Arguments for Request carries over from root path to /auth
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* Why does testmod0.py also run when it is only imported and a flask object was not created in it
* Does importing testmod0.py create a separate flask object?
* How would you return different results depending on what username you write?
* Could you store user data to be accessed later (e.g. for a login page)?
* What is sub1 and how was it added to args, how can we add more subs?
* Why does ?username=ads&sub1=Submit+Query show up in the URL?
